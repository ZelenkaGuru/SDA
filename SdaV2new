Steam Desktop Authenticator
A desktop implementation of Steam's mobile authenticator app.
We are not affiliated with Steam or Scrap.TF in any way! This project is run by community volunteers.

WARNING: Recently there have been fake versions of SDA floating around that will steal your Steam account. Never download SDA from any place other than this github repo!
Download here
Supports Windows 7 and up.


Clicking "Download ZIP" will not work! This project uses git submodules so you must use git to download it properly. Using GitHub Desktop is an easy way to do that.

DISCLAIMER: We provide no support for you when using Steam Desktop Authenticator! This project is run by community volunteers and is not affiliated with Steam or Scrap.TF. You use this program at your own risk, and accept the responsibility to make backups and prevent unauthorized access to your computer!

REMEMBER: Always make backups of your maFiles directory! If you lose your encryption key or delete maFiles by accident AND you didn't save your revocation code, you are screwed.

FINALLY: Using this application is a bad idea, because it COMPLETELY DEFEATS THE PURPOSE of two-factor authentication! If your desktop is infected with a virus, it will be able to hijack the authenticator app and completely subvert the protection. THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT PROTECT YOUR ACCOUNT; IT ONLY ALLOWS YOU TO USE STEAM FEATURES THAT REQUIRE THE AUTHENTICATOR WITHOUT HAVING A PHONE. If you have a phone that supports the Mobile Authenticator, you really shouldn't use this application!

IF you lost your maFiles OR lost your encryption key, go here and click "Remove Authenticator" then enter your revocation code that you wrote down when you first added your account to SDA.

If you did not follow the directions and did not write your revocation code down, you're well and truly screwed. The only option is beg to Steam Support and say you lost your mobile authenticator and the revocation code.
